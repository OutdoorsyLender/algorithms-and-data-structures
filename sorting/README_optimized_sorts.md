# optimized-sorting-algorithms

This project compares several sorting algorithms, including optimized versions. It measures runtime differences across random, reverse-sorted, and almost-sorted lists.

This project was completed for CSC506 – Module 6.

## How It Works

1. Lists of various sizes are generated.
2. Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort all run on each list.
3. Optimized versions include improvements like early exits and better pivot selection.
4. Runtimes are calculated and printed.

## Features

**Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort  
- Optimized Bubble Sort

- Printed timing comparisons  

## Files Included

**optimized_sorts.py**  
Full program including all sorting algorithms and testing code.

**optimized_sorts.pdf**  
Write-up explaining results and what I learned.

## How to Run the Program

```
python optimized_sorts.py
```

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how different sorting algorithms behave and why optimized versions can significantly improve performance. I also learned how input patterns affect sorting time.

# patient-record-sort

This project simulates sorting hospital patient records using Bubble Sort and Merge Sort. It demonstrates how algorithm choice matters when working with growing datasets.

This project was completed as part of CSC506.

## How It Works

1. Faker is used to generate random patient names, IDs, and admission dates.
2. Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are used to sort the list by patient ID.
3. Sample records and timing results are printed.

## Features

**PatientRecord Class**
- ID  
- Name  
- Admission date  

**Sorting**
- Bubble Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Time comparison  

## Files Included

**patient_sort.py**  
Main Python program with data generation and sorting functions.

Write-up explaining the project and what I learned.

## How to Run the Program

Install Faker:

```
pip install faker
```

Then run:

```
python patient_sort.py
```

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand data classes, list sorting, and why faster algorithms matter when working with large collections of records.

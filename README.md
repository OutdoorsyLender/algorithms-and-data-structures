# python-algorithms-portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Python projects demonstrating core algorithms and data‑structures concepts learned throughout CSC500 and CSC506.  
Each project has its own folder with a fully formatted README, the Python source code, and the matching write‑up.

The goal of this repo is to keep all coursework‑based algorithm projects organized in one place and make them easy to review for instructors, recruiters, and future employers.

## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

1. Install Python 3.  
2. Open the project folder you want to run.  
3. Run the Python file from the terminal:

```
python filename.py
```

Some projects may require small libraries (like `faker`). If so, the README in that folder will mention it.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Standard Libraries  
- Faker (for the patient record project)

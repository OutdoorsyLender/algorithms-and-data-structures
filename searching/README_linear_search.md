# nfl-jersey-linear-search

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates linear search using an NFL jersey example. The user types in a team or player, and the program scans the list to find matching jerseys.

This project was completed as part of my CSC506 coursework.

## How It Works

The program runs in the terminal and works like this:

1. A list of jersey dictionaries is created.
2. The user enters search text.
3. A linear search checks each jersey.
4. Matching jerseys are printed.

## Features

**Jersey Inventory**
- Player name  
- Team  
- Jersey number  
- Price  

**Linear Search System**
- Case‑insensitive matching  
- Scans each entry one by one  
- Displays all matching results  

## Files Included

**jersey_linear_search.py**  
Main Python file with the jersey list and the search function.

**jersey_linear_search.pdf**  
Write-up explaining the project and what I learned.

## How to Run the Program

```
python jersey_linear_search.py
```

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how linear search works and why it grows slower as lists get larger. It also helped me practice filtering data and building small terminal programs.
